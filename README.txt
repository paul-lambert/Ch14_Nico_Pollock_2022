Lambert, P. S., & Barnett, C. (2021). Optimising the use of measures of social stratification in research with intersectional and longitudinal analytical priorities. In M. Nico & G. Pollock (Eds.), The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Inequalities and the Life Course (pp. 188-198). London: Routledge.


Comments: 

The uploaded files include code used for the entire process of analysis (e.g. data preparation and analysis activities). Most people accessing the files will not be interested in the bulk of the replication code (much of which would be very difficult to make sense of in isolation). We anticipate that most people accessing the files are only interested in viewing the mechanisms that were used to summarise relationships with stratification in longitudinal and intersectional contexts in order to generate the results in the tables published in the chapter above. These sections of code can be found in the 'analytical_commands.do' file, listed by table number.
